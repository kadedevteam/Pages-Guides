## Creating a website with Github Pages Pro

## About GitHub Pages Pro

**GitHub Pages Pro** is a updated version of **GitHub Pages** witch is a site hosting service that takes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files straight from a repository on GitHub, optionally runs the files through a build process, and publishes a website. You can see a site demo of pages pro here: [Link](https://kadedevteam.github.io/Github-Website-Demo/)

You can host your site on GitHub's `github.io` domain or your own custom domain. For more information, see [Creating Custom Domains/URL(S)]()

To get started, see [Creating a Site]() located below

Organization owners can disable the publication of GitHub Pages sites from the organization's repositories. For more information, see "Managing the publication of GitHub Pages sites for your organization."

### Types Of Websites

There are three types of GitHub Pages sites: project, user, and organization. Project sites are connected to a specific project hosted on GitHub, such as a JavaScript library or a recipe collection. User and organization sites are connected to a specific GitHub account.

To publish a user site, you must create a repository owned by your user account that's named `<username>.github.io.` To publish an organization site, you must create a repository owned by an organization that's named `<organization>.github.io.` Unless you're using a custom domain, user and organization sites are available at `http(s)://<username>.github.io `or `http(s)://<organization>.github.io.`

The source files for a project site are stored in the same repository as their project. Unless you're using a custom domain, project sites are available at `http(s)://<username>.github.io/<repository> or http(s)://<organization>.github.io/<repository>.`

If you publish your site privately, the URL for your site will be different. For more information, see "Changing the visibility of your GitHub Pages site."

For more information about how custom domains affect the URL for your site, see "About custom domains and GitHub Pages."

You can only create one user or organization site for each account on GitHub. Project sites, whether owned by an organization or a user account, are unlimited.

### Jeykll Engine

Pages Pro will use the Jekyll Engine for Obviouse Reasons! Check out the Jekyll Engine for more info about the engine! You can find the` _config.yml,` `index.md,` and `default.html` in `.Jekyll!` or in the main source!
