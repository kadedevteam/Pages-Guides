## Creating a custom 404 page for your GitHub Pages Pro site
### You can display a custom 404 error page when people try to access nonexistent pages on your site.

- First open up your source code! and head to `assets/` then create a new folder and call it `404-custom`
- Inside `404-custom` create a file called `404-custom-data.md` and `404.html` 
- Inside of `404.html` type in `permalink: /404.html` 
- Now inside of `404-custom-data.md` type in what you want your custom 404 page to say!
- Now Build your Website and try it out!

**NOTE**: If you have more than one email address associated with your GitHub account, click the email address drop-down menu and select the email address to use as the Git author email address. Only verified email addresses appear in this drop-down menu. If you enabled email address privacy, then `username>@users.noreply.github.com` is the default commit author email address. Make sure this is done in `gh-pro` branch!
